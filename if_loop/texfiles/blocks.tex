\frametitle{Code blocks}

In Python, conditional statements and loops are defined with code blocks, which have in common:

\begin{itemize}
\item{The block definition must end with \verb+:+}
\item{The code inside the block must be indented to the right}
\item{When leaving the block, the code  must be indented to the left}
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Warning}
Indent issues occur often, be carefull
\end{alertblock}

\begin{block}{Warning}
With some text editors, the \verb+tab+ keys would make your code incompatible with other systems.
Use 4 spaces instead.
\end{block}
